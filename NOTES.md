##### NEXT TIME, BEFORE MAKING A BIG CHANGE, MAKE A NEW BRANCH MAN

##### How to update and redeploy website:

1. push changes- force the push using -f for gh-pages (I know that's bad practice, but since I'm working on this alone it should be fine, I should probably also figure out the proper way to do it)
2. bring other branch up to date with the one you just pushed changes to using "git rebase"
3. push changes for updated branch
4. run "npm run deploy"
5. Re-add custom domain in Github
