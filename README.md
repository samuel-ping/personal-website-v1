# My Personal Website

The main site is done!

## Things to do

- Pictures in pages
- More details in pages- use cards list for projects
- In the navbar, show which tab you're currently in. Use state for this... probably. Can fill background color for tab changing effect. For reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30376922/how-to-manage-active-state-in-bootstrap-navbar-in-react
- Add tooltips to icon buttons
- Add "scroll up" button at bottom of each navbar tab
- Make stuff fade in (use React-Motion?)
- Make resume icon more like a button like on Sydney's website :p But it might not as good, who knows
- Scrollbar support for Firefox?
- Credits are a little messed up on Firefox (too high), I made a temp solution but it bothers me
- Add Google Analytics?
- Responsiveness can always use some work
- If you make the screen super thin, small white space at bottom of website :(
- ~~Get main website finished~~ Done!
- ~~Update all the pages~~ Done!
- ~~Add credits at bottom~~
- ~~Make the scrolling arrow work!~~ Done! Used react-scroll!
- ~~Make navbar sticky!~~
- ~~Add credits for icons~~
- ~~Find icons that don't require attribution :p~~ Done! (they're from https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- ~~Icon links only work on the icon part of the button, not the whole thing~~
- ~~It looks so ugly on mobile!!! Responsive web design? Scaling stuff to device dimensions?~~
- ~~Navbar broken on smaller screens!~~
- ~~Changed accent color from purple to red~~
