# My Personal Website

The main site is done!

## Things to do

- ~~Get main website finished~~ Done!
- ~~Update all the pages~~ Done!
- Pictures in pages
- ~~Add credits at bottom~~
- ~~Make the scrolling arrow work! (react-scroll? scrollIntoView()?) Scroll down until you reach navbar. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43441856/reactjs-how-to-scroll-to-an-element)~~ Done! Used react-scroll!
- ~~Make navbar sticky!~~
- In the navbar, show which tab you're currently in. Use state for this... probably. Can fill background color for tab changing effect. For reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30376922/how-to-manage-active-state-in-bootstrap-navbar-in-react
- Add tooltips to icon buttons
- Add "scroll up" button at bottom of each navbar tab
- Make stuff fade in (use React-Motion?)
- Responsive web design? Scaling stuff to device dimensions?
- Make resume icon more like a button like on Sydney's website :p But it might not as good, who knows
- ~~Add credits for icons~~
