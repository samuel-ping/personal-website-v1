# My Personal Website

It's currently a work in progress!

## Things to do

- ~~Get main website finished~~ Done!
- ~~Update all the pages~~ Done!
- Pictures in pages
- ~~Add credits at bottom~~
- Make the scrolling arrow work! (react-scroll? scrollIntoView()?) Scroll down until you reach navbar.
- ~~Make navbar sticky!~~
- In the navbar, show which tab you're currently in. Use state for this... probably. Can fill background color for tab changing effect. For reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30376922/how-to-manage-active-state-in-bootstrap-navbar-in-react
- Add tooltips to buttons
- Make stuff fade in (use React-Motion?)
- Responsive web design? Scaling stuff to device dimensions?
- Make resume icon more like a button like on Sydney's website :p But it might not as good, who knows
- Add credits for icons (<div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect" title="Pixel perfect">Pixel perfect</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/"     title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></div><div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/vitaly-gorbachev" title="Vitaly Gorbachev">Vitaly Gorbachev</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/"     title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></div>)
