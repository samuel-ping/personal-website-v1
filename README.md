# My Personal Website

It's currently a work in progress!

## Things to do

- Get main website finished
- Make the scrolling arrow work! (react-scroll? scrollIntoView()?) Scroll down until you reach navbar.
- In the navbar, show which tab you're currently in. Use state for this... probably. For reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30376922/how-to-manage-active-state-in-bootstrap-navbar-in-react
- Add tooltips to buttons
- Make stuff fade in (use React-Motion?)
- Responsive web design? Scaling stuff to device dimensions?
- Make resume icon more like a button like on Sydney's website :p But it might not as good, who knows
